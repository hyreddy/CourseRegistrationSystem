# CourseRegistrationSystem
The point of this project was to design and implement a Course Registration System that was able to store data locally through serialization and allow multiple users to modify the data based on their credentials. The program initially used a csv file with student, course, and teacher data to populate its system, but every subsequent run used the serialized data. The system has two types of users: Admin and Student.

CourseRegSys is the command line version while CourseRegGUI is the graphical interface version of this project

Steps for running CourseRegSystem

1) Go to Eclipse and create an empty java project
2) Use the import file feature and import the folder "CourseRegSys" or "CourseRegGUI"
3) Go to project's properties within eclipse and ensure the default run time is set to SE-11 in Libraries/ Module path under Java Build Path
4) Open the java file "RunCRS" and press run
5) Use the Admin credentials: Username: Admin, Password: Admin001 to use the program
